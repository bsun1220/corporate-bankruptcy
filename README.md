# corporate-bankruptcy
data science project to predict corporate bankruptcy <br/>
- highly unbalanced dataset of corporate bankrupcies in Taiwan from 1997 - 2010 (about 10% of the dataset contained bankruptcy) <br/>
- used data science techniques like selectkth best, mutual information, and principal components analysis for feature engineering <br/>
- used both sampling (reduced sample size) and SMOTE (synthetic samples) to deal with highly unbalanced data for classification <br/>
- worked with 7 different classifer models (decision classifer, random forest classifier, gradient boost, etc) <br/>
- overall achieved AUC of 95% on the data set
